# Student-Progress-Indicator-SPI

| WELCOME TO SPI(STUDENT PROGRESS INDICATOR) |

 ---------------
| Introduction |
 ---------------

Student progress indicator or "SPI" was built with a view to reduce the paper work, increase the use of digital medias. It is a complete C++, console based system. We have tried to complete the full project with all of the required criteria's. But still there must be some update with some new features and characteristics. Stay tuned with us to get more special features.

Thank you everyone.

| Background Informations |
---------------------------

Digitization has revolutionized the information, media, and all industry sector. In this advanced world, everything is being digital. So, to maintain the sequence with the daily update  of this volatile world, we also need to be updated. But still, most of our work or document is paper based.

From research, we found that, about 19 million student is available in Bangladesh. In most of our public and private schools, student progress sheet is considered as a very important document for a student’s future activity. But currently all these progress reports are paper based. School authority publishes the report card only after the term test and only on that time student and their parents can observe the result of their child. But a student should be monitored on a daily basis of his/her daily studies.

From this point onward, the system is going to be introduced here is "Student Progress Indicator" or "SPI" in short. Through this system evaluation of a student is much more easier and effective.
